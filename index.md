# Pianola

[![Pianola](/assets/img/PianolaScreenshot.png)](https://pianola.app)

An application that plays AI-generated piano music, Pianola uses a large language model - but the language is music! Users seed (i.e. "prompt") the AI model by playing notes on the keyboard, or choosing example snippets from classical pieces.

[See it in action](https://pianola.app), or learn more on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ruce/pianola)!

# Colour AI

[![Colour AI](/assets/img/ColourAIScreenshot.png)](https://ruce.github.io/colour-ai/)

A text-to-colour encoder-decoder model based on my Master's thesis, _Representing Vagueness with Probabilistic Semantics_. Describe one of the colours using words and see if the AI can guess it. Might not be as simple as it initially seems when the colours are very similar...

Try it [here](https://ruce.github.io/colour-ai/)!
