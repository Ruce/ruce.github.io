# Colour AI

[![Colour AI](/assets/img/ColourAIScreenshot.png)](https://ruce.github.io/colour-ai/)

A text-to-colour encoder-decoder model based on my Master's thesis, _Representing Vagueness with Probabilistic Semantics_. Describe one of the colours using words and see if the AI can guess it. Might not be as simple as it initially seems when the colours are very similar...

Try it [here](https://ruce.github.io/colour-ai/).
